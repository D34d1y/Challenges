## Challenges

Welcome to the **Learn Python!** repository for weekly challenges!

### What can I find here?

This repository will contain a backlog of all the weekly challenges, as well as solutions added at the end of the week for you to compare with.

For certain challenges tests will be included as well that can be used to ensure your implementation works.

### How to run tests?

Tests will be using the standard PyUnit unit-testing framework unless otherwise specified, and can be ran according to more specific instructions found in the challenges' folders.
