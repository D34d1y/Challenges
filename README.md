## Challenges

Welcome to the **Learn Python!** repository for weekly challenges!

### What can I find here?

This repository will contain a backlog of all the weekly challenges, as well as solutions added at the end of the week for you to compare with.

Each week's challenges are stored in a folder on the root following the naming convention of `YYYY_MM_DD_challenges` so they can be sorted chronologically by the file system.

For certain challenges tests will be included as well that can be used to ensure your implementation works.

### How to run tests?

Tests will be using the standard PyUnit unit-testing framework unless otherwise specified, and can be ran according to more specific instructions found in the challenges' folders.
