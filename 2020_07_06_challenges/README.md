# 2020 06 07 Weekly Challenges

Welcome to the weekly challenges for the week of the 2020/06/07!

## Challenges

So that you can later use the prebuilt test suite to make sure all the implementations work, you need to clone this folder and write all your code in the `challenges.py` file using the class and method stubs prepared for you.

### Beginner

1. Return `True` in `is_even` if the given number is even, else `False`.
2. Return `True` in `is_prime` if the given number is a prime number, else `False`.
3. Return `True` in `is_mersenne` if the given number is a Mersenne prime, else `False`.

### Intermediate

1. Complete the `class Car` to store attributes.
2. Introduce type-hinting in the constructor of `class Car`.
   - `weight` is `int`
   - `wheels` is `int`
   - `passengers` is `int`
   - `model_number` is `int`
   - `manufacturer` is `str`
3. Override the `__repr__` method so `print(car)` responds with:
   `Car weight: <weight> | Car wheels: <wheels> | Passengers: <passengers> | Model number: <model_number>`

### Proficient

1. Implement a simple binary tree using the stub for `class TreeNode`.
2. Implement the `check_tree` function to check if two given binary trees are identical.
3. Implement the `invert_tree` function to invert a binary tree.

### Advanced

1. Implement [partition theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_(number_theory)) in Python using the `possible_partitions` method stub.

## Running Tests

After completing these challenges, you can run the `run_tests.py` file through the command line or a run tool in your IDE/editor of choice, and view the output of the tests to make sure all the tests pass.

**Note:** The test suite has been tested with Python 3.8 although it will be functional with older versions, it might not work as expected.
